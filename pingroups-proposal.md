# Digital Pin Groups (Proposal)

Provides support for the situation where you want to set or get the values of 
an arbitrary set of digital IO pins that may not necessarily align to a port and 
do all of this in one operation.
为要设置或获取的数字IO引脚不一定对齐到端口，做这一切在一个操作中的任意一组的值的情况下支持。



Examples of this behaviour would include:
这种行为的例子包括：

* Analog Multiplexer / Demultimplexer, where you need to set the bit value of
three pins in order to determine which analog line is being used on the multiplexer.
*模拟多路复用器/ Demultimplexer，你需要设置的位值
三个销以确定哪些模拟线路上正在多路复用使用。

* Keypads where the value of the key presses are expressed using a combination of
states across a set of digital lines (eg: [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8653](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8653) )
*其中按键的价值正在使用的组合表示键盘
在一组数字线路状态（例如：[https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8653](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8653））

When you want to issue an equivalent of a digitalWrite to a group of pins,
you'll then issue a sequence of 7-bit bytes that provides the states of the pins collectively. 
This will save several calls to digital write and allow them to be done in one group.
当你想发出digitalWrite的相当于一组引脚，
那么你会发出的，提供了引脚的状态集体7位字节序列。
这将节省几个电话到数字写，让他们在一个组来完成。

Reads will work the same way but return a byte with the states of all of the pins.
This is particularly important in a scenario like a keypad where independent
async reads can make it extremely challenging to get the state of the keypress properly.
将读取的工作方式相同，但与所有的引脚的状态返回一个字节。
这是在像一个小键盘的情形特别重要，其中独立
异步读取可以使它极具挑战性，以获得按键状态正常。

## Requirements

* Currently unimplemented (PoC to come shortly)
* An array of pin groups (suggest 8 groups so it can be identifed with 3 bits 
each with up to 14 pins defined in the group)
* Modifications to firmata to accept the new protocol.

## Protocol

### Digital Pin Group commands

In order to save space in the protocol, the Digital Pin Group command comprises
both protocol commands as well as the id address space for the groups as below:

LSB
0 - 2:  3 bits to determine which Pin Group command is being issued
3    :  Reserved for future use / address space increases
4 - 6:  3 bits for Pin Group ID address space - providing up to 8 distinct digital pin groups

Command values are provided below
```
CONFIG              (0x00)
CLEAR               (0x01)
PIN_STATE_SET       (0x02)
PIN_STATE_REQUEST   (0x03)
PIN_STATE_REPLY     (0x04)
future reserved     (0x05 - 0x07)
```

### Configuration

Specifies which pins should be grouped together and in which order. A maximum
of 14 pins can be grouped together in one pin group. When specified in the config
message, the pins will be provided in little endian style so the first pin will
then be configured to mapped to the Least Significant Bit in subsequent write
and read messages.

```
0:  START_SYSEX         (0xF0)
1:  pin group command   (0x60)
2:  pin group id (0 - 7) << 4 | CONFIG
3:  lowest bit set for pinMode (0=READ, 1=WRITE) top 6 bits reserved
4:  first pin in pin group (0 - 127)
5:  second pin in pin group (0 - 127)
... up to maximum of 14
N:  END_SYSEX           (0xF7)
```

### Clear

Removes any pin entries associated to a pin group. This should free up any
memory that has been allocted and remove any references to the pins that were
configured. This is to ensure no side effects occur if a pin group is recycled.

```
0:  START_SYSEX         (0xF0)
1:  pin group command   (0x60)
2:  pin group id (0 -7) << 4 | CLEAR
3:  END_SYSEX           (0xF7)
```

### State set

Sets the states of the pins in the group. As noted above, the first pin that
is supplied in the config will be considered the least significant bit in this
message. Any values provided that don't match the config definition should simply
be ignored (ie a value comes through for the 5th pin in the group but none was
defined so it should be ignored).

```
0:  START_SYSEX         (0xF0)
1:  pin group command   (0x60)
2:  pin group id (0 - 7) << 4 | PIN_STATE_SET
3:  packed 7 bit array as single byte providing values for the pin group
... optional second packed 7 bit array providing values for the pin group
N:  END_SYSEX           (0xF7)
```

### State request and reply

Getting the states of the group of pins (essentially a group digital read)
comprises a request to the board and a reply back.

Make a request for getting the states of the pin group.

```
0:  START_SYSEX         (0xF0)
1:  pin group command   (0x60)
2:  pin group id (0 - 7) << 4 | PIN_STATE_REQUEST
3:  END_SYSEX
```

Reply with the pin states.

```
0:  START_SYSEX         (0xF0)
1:  pin group command   (0x60)
2:  pin group id (0 - 7) << 4 | PIN_STATE_REPLY
3:  packed 7 bit array representing pin states, LSB is first pin defined in config
... optional second 7 bit array representing pin states for additional pins in group
N:  END_SYSEX
```
