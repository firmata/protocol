Firmata is a generic [protocol](protocol.md) for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a host computer. It is intended to work with any host computer software package. Right now there is a matching object in a number of languages (provide link to list). It is easy to add objects for other software to use this protocol. Basically, this firmware establishes a protocol for talking to the microcontroller from the host software.

Current (official) Version : v2.3 

Firmaware implementations are availables on [firmata/arduino](https://github.com/firmata/arduino), see `Master` and `Configurable` branches. Examples files can also be found on Arduino IDE in `File -> Examples -> Firmata`.


TO DO:

- update description on this page perhaps providing any rationale behind design decisions (from design issues section on Firmata.org wiki)
- define process for contributing to this project
- provide link to firmata/firmata_test/
- update firmata_test repository to include all relevant info from the Firmata.org main page
- provide links to Firmata implementation (firmata/arduino)... any others out there. I know there was a PIC version in the works and maybe an LPC version as well.
- provide links to projects using firmata
- provide links to client implementations (this is currently on the firmata/arduino readme)
